A lot of business owners only look at their website when they need to change something.

That's understandable. If it looks fine and seems to be working, it's easy to assume everything's okay.

The problem is that many website issues don't announce themselves loudly. They sit quietly in the background while customers hit broken forms, slow pages, or error messages you never see.

So how often should a business website actually be checked?

## A quick check should happen weekly

At a minimum, a website should get a quick once-over every week.

This doesn't need to be technical or time-consuming. It's about spotting obvious problems early.

A weekly check usually means:

- loading the homepage and a few key pages
- testing the contact form
- checking that the site loads properly on mobile
- making sure nothing looks broken or out of place

Think of it like walking past your shopfront. You're not renovating, you're just making sure the lights are on and the door opens.

## Behind-the-scenes checks should happen more often

While a visual check once a week is fine, the technical side of a website needs more frequent attention.

Updates, security monitoring, and uptime checks should be happening continuously or at least several times a week.

That includes:

- monitoring whether the site goes offline
- watching for security warnings or unusual activity
- applying updates safely when they're released

Most of this is automated, but someone still needs to be responsible for reviewing alerts and acting on them.

## Content should be reviewed every few months

Even when a website is technically healthy, content can quietly fall out of date.

Every few months, it's worth checking:

- contact details
- services and pricing
- staff information
- calls to action
- testimonials and case studies

Outdated content doesn't just look sloppy. It creates doubt. If a visitor can't trust the information on your site, they're less likely to trust your business.

## Deeper reviews make sense once or twice a year

Once or twice a year, most small business websites benefit from a more thorough review.

This might include:

- performance and speed checks
- a security review
- checking compatibility with newer browsers and devices
- reviewing whether the site still supports your business goals

This is the equivalent of a proper service, not just a quick look under the bonnet.

## Why "only when something breaks" is risky

Waiting until something breaks usually means:

- the problem has been there for a while
- customers have already been affected
- the fix is more stressful and more expensive

Regular checks turn emergencies into routine maintenance. Small issues are easier to fix when they're caught early.

## If you don't have time to check it, that's normal

Most business owners shouldn't be spending their time checking websites. That's not what you're good at, and it's not the best use of your energy.

That's exactly why website management exists.

I help small businesses by regularly checking, maintaining, and looking after their websites so problems are handled quietly in the background.
