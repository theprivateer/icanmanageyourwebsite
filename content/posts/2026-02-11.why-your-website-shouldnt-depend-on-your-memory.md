title: "Why your website shouldn't depend on your memory"

Most business websites don't break because someone did something wrong.

They break because someone forgot.

Not out of carelessness, but because running a business already requires you to remember a hundred other things that matter more than website logins and renewal dates.

When a website depends on your memory, it's fragile by default.

## Forgotten logins are more common than you think

It usually starts small.

The person who set up the site used their own email address.

Passwords were saved in a browser that's long gone.

Details were written down "somewhere safe".

Months or years later, something needs changing and no one can log in.

At that point:

- access has to be recovered
- accounts need to be tracked down
- time is lost just getting back to square one

A website you can't access is a website you don't really control.

## Missed renewals can take a site offline overnight

Websites rely on renewals that are easy to forget:

- domain names
- hosting plans
- SSL certificates
- premium plugins or services

If one of these lapses, the site can suddenly go offline, show security warnings, or stop working properly.

Often the reminder emails go to an old address or land in spam. By the time someone notices, customers already have.

## Lost knowledge is a silent risk

Many websites are held together by undocumented knowledge.

Only one person knows:

- where it's hosted
- how updates are done
- what breaks if you change the wrong thing

If that person leaves, gets busy, or is simply unavailable, the website becomes risky to touch.

Even simple changes feel dangerous when no one is confident about how the site works.

## Memory doesn't scale with your business

As your business grows, relying on memory becomes more fragile.

More tools.

More accounts.

More things that quietly expire in the background.

Your website shouldn't compete with payroll, clients, staff, and deadlines for mental space. It should be something you can trust to just work.

## This is what support actually looks like

For non-technical and time-poor businesses, good website support means:

- logins and access are documented and secure
- renewals are tracked and handled
- knowledge lives outside one person's head
- someone is responsible for the site over time

It removes the stress of "I hope nothing goes wrong" and replaces it with "someone's got this".

## If your website lives in your head, it's time to change that

If your website depends on you remembering how it works, when things renew, or who to call when something breaks, you're carrying more risk than you should.

I help businesses by taking ownership of that responsibility. I look after the details, keep things organised, and make sure your website doesn't rely on memory or luck.
