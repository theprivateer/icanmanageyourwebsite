                <h1 class="size-6xl">Website management you don't have to think about</h1>

                <p>Running a business is hard enough without worrying about your website. I provide ongoing website management for small to medium sized businesses that want their site kept online, secure, and up to date without having to deal with the technical details.</p>
                <p>With over 20 years of professional experience, I am a trusted and reliable web designer and developer who looks after websites so business owners can focus on their work.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">Support for non-technical and time-poor businesses</h2>

                <p>Many of my clients do not want to learn how hosting, updates, or security patches work. They just want their website to be there when customers need it.</p>

                <p>I work with:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Small business owners with limited time</li>
                    <li>Teams without in-house technical staff</li>
                    <li>Businesses that rely on their website but do not want to manage it</li>
                    <li>Organisations that need a dependable point of contact</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You deal with a real person who knows your website, not a generic support desk.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">WordPress problems fixed properly</h2>

                <p>WordPress is powerful, but it can quickly become unstable when themes, plugins, and updates are poorly managed. I regularly repair WordPress websites that have broken after updates, suffered performance issues, or become bloated and unreliable over time.</p>
                <p>That may involve fixing plugin conflicts, cleaning up themes, improving performance, or recommending a safer long-term approach if WordPress is no longer the right fit.</p>

            <section class="container">
                <h2 class="size-5xl">Managed hosting that stays online</h2>

                <p>I provide managed hosting that is fast, secure, and monitored. That includes keeping your site running, handling server updates, and responding quickly if something goes wrong.</p>
                <p>You do not need to worry about renewals, technical alerts, or sudden outages. Your website is actively looked after.</p>

            <section class="container">
                <h2 class="size-5xl">Security fixes and regular maintenance</h2>

                <p>Websites need ongoing care to stay secure. I handle security updates, apply patches, and monitor for issues that could put your site at risk.</p>
                <p>For WordPress and other CMS-based websites, this includes maintaining plugins, themes, and core updates in a controlled way that reduces the chance of things breaking.</p>

            <section class="container">
                <h2 class="size-5xl">Content updates without the hassle</h2>

                <p>If you need changes made to your website, I can handle them for you. That might be updating text and images, adding new pages, posting news or blog content, or making small layout improvements.</p>
                <p>You can send updates by email or message and know they will be taken care of properly, without you having to log in or learn a system.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">Reliable service at a fair price</h2>

                <p>My services are competitively and fairly priced, with clear expectations and no surprises. The goal is not to upsell or overcomplicate things, but to provide steady, dependable support.</p>
                <p>If something needs attention, I will tell you. If nothing does, your site simply keeps working in the background.</p>

                <h2 class="size-5xl">Keep your website online and up to date</h2>

                <p>If you want your website managed by someone experienced, reliable, and easy to work with, I can help. Whether you need full management or light ongoing support, we can find an arrangement that suits your business.</p>
